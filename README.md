Contributions to the roblox-ts documentation are welcome!

All docs can be found within the `docs` folder, which are markdown files.

## Local Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

To build the interactive playground:
1. `cd ./rbxts-worker`
2. `npm install`
3. `cd ..`
2. `npm run start:playground`

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
