Contributions to the roblox-ts documentation are welcome!

All docs can be found within the `docs` folder, which are markdown files.

## Local Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

In order to get the interactive playground to work, these commands will also need to be run:
1. `npm run install:rbxts-worker`
2. `npm run build:rbxts-worker`

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.

Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
