title: Syncing with Rojo
---

## Introduction

The role of roblox-ts is to turn TypeScript (`.ts`) files into Luau files (`.lua`). That alone isn't very useful! You need to move the files into Roblox Studio to be able to use them for a game, plugin, model, etc.

To do this, you can use [Rojo](https://rojo.space/)!

Rojo takes files from your local filesystem and will either:
- turn them into a single Roblox file (`.rbxm`, `.rbxl`, `.rbxmx`, or `.rbxlx`) via `rojo build`
- sync them into an open Roblox Studio session via `rojo serve`

Rojo uses a `default.project.json` file to describe how files should be organized within a Roblox file.

:::note Heads up!
Your `default.project.json` file should have all `"$path"` fields relative to your `outDir` (which is the `"out"` folder by default).
:::

The workflow should look like this:

import DownArrow from "../components/downArrow";

<div style={{ fontSize: "20px" }}>

`.ts` files (in `src`)

<DownArrow />

roblox-ts (`rbxtsc`)

<DownArrow />

`.lua` files (in `out`)

<DownArrow />

Rojo (`rojo build` or `rojo serve`)

<DownArrow />

Roblox Studio :tada:

</div>

## Customization

Like any other Rojo project, you can organize a roblox-ts project however you'd like with a few restrictions:
- The `include` folder and `node_modules` folder must be in a place that is visible to both the client and server
- All `"$path"` fields should be relative to your `outDir` (which is the `"out"` folder by default)

By default, the `default.project.json` file should look something like this (truncated):
```json
{
	"name": "roblox-ts-game",
	"tree": {
		"$className": "DataModel",
		"ServerScriptService": {
			"$className": "ServerScriptService",
			"TS": {
				"$path": "out/server" // server folder goes in ServerScriptService.TS
			}
		},
		"ReplicatedStorage": {
			"$className": "ReplicatedStorage",
			// this _must_ stay the same (except for the name)
			"rbxts_include": {
				"$path": "include",
				"node_modules": {
					"$path": "node_modules/@rbxts"
				}
			},
			"TS": {
				"$path": "out/shared" // shared folder goes in ReplicatedStorage.TS
			}
		},
		"StarterPlayer": {
			"$className": "StarterPlayer",
			"StarterPlayerScripts": {
				"$className": "StarterPlayerScripts",
				"TS": {
					"$path": "out/client" // client folder goes in StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.TS
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
