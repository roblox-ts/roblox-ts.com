title: LuaTuple<T>
---


## The Problem

Given the following Luau code, how do we type it?

```lua
local function foo()
	return "abc", 123
end
```

Multiple returns are a common occurrence in Luau, but not really a concept in TypeScript. [TypeScript does have a feature called "tuples"](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#tuple) which allow for fixed length array types with an individual type for each index.

So we might type this as:
```ts
declare function foo(): [string, number];
```

However, this is not correct! TypeScript tuples are arrays, not multiple returns. It would expect the Luau to be `return { "abc", 123 }`.

## The Solution

To solve this problem, roblox-ts introduces a special type called `LuaTuple<T>`. This is typed as:
```ts
type LuaTuple<T extends Array<any>> = T & { readonly LUA_TUPLE: never };
```

`LUA_TUPLE` is used to ensure the type name is not lost or cast into an `Array<T>` accidentally.

When the compiler sees this type as a function return type, it can infer that it's meant to be a multiple return.

In general, this type is used for typing existing Luau modules or the Roblox API.

## Examples

If you immediately destructure the result, it will be compiled into a simple variable declaration from a multiple return.
```ts
const [actualTimeYielded, totalTime] = wait(1);
```

If you do _not_ destructure the result, the compiler will wrap the return in `{ }` and turn the result into an array object.
```ts
const result = wait(1);
const actualTimeYielded = result[0];
const totalTime = result[1];
```

You can also index the result immediately after the function call and receive an optimized emit:
```ts
import { Players } from "@rbxts/services";

// .Wait() here returns LuaTuple<[character: Model]>,
// so we need to use `[0]` to grab the first (and only) element.
const character = Players.LocalPlayer.Character || Players.LocalPlayer.CharacterAdded.Wait()[0];
```

## Using `LuaTuple<T>` in Your Own Code

The compiler supports using `LuaTuple<T>` in outside of type definitions, but it's generally not recommended. However, if you're writing code that is consumed by an existing Luau module this can be useful!

Fortunately, we have a macro called `$tuple` that covers multiple returns so that you don't need to type assert the function return yourself every time you want it to be a tuple.

```ts
function hasMultipleReturns() {
	// this will compile into `return "abc", 123`
	return $tuple("abc", 123);
}
```
