title: Upgrading to Yarn v3
---

Set the version to 'stable'

`yarn set verion stable`

Run `yarn` so it upgrades the lockfiles, once upgraded you can remove the old `.yarnrc` file, while in the new `.yarnrc.yml` make sure `nodeLinker: node-modules` exist as roblox-ts does **not** support PNP.

If you opened the project in vscode you should see it error out as typescript panics, to fix this you have to add [sdks](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks).

`yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode` 

You may also add [plugins](https://yarnpkg.com/features/plugins/) such as [upgrade-interactive](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/upgrade-interactive) to easily upgrade dependencies
