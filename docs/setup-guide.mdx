title: Setup Guide

:::note
This guide assumes you know how to use the command line. You can find tutorials on YouTube for [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiTZgpRpWv0) or [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKRYQsKR46I).
:::

## Before You Begin

In order to start using roblox-ts, you'll need to have the following software already installed:
- [NodeJS 14+](https://nodejs.org/)
- A code editor. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- [Rojo 6+](https://rojo.space/). The easiest way to install it is through the [Rojo VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo).

## Installation

Once you have NodeJS properly installed, it should come with an `npm` command for your command line.

To install the latest version of roblox-ts, simply run:
```bash
npm install -g roblox-ts
```

This command will install roblox-ts globally on your system. You can now use `rbxtsc` in your command line.

## Project Setup

To start using roblox-ts to create a game project, follow these steps:

<!-- Unfortunately, we need to explicitly number these steps because there are images between them :( -->

1. Create a new folder and give it a name. The folder name cannot contain spaces. We are going to name ours `my-project`.

2. Open the folder using your code editor (or your command line if your code editor does not have one integrated).

<center><img src={require("../static/img/setup-guide/open-with-vscode.png").default} /></center>

:::info VSCode for MacOS
VSCode in MacOS does not have a natively integrated "Open with Code" option for a right click, therefore you must use the command line to open the folder.

If you want to add an "Open with Code" option for a right click, [more info here](./articles/open-with-vscode-macos).

3. Run `rbxtsc init game` in your command line to start the interactive project setup.

:::caution PowerShell
If you're using PowerShell for the first time, you may get an error about "running scripts is disabled on this system". You can fix this by running the following in PowerShell as an administrator:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

[More info here](./articles/powershell)

4. Start roblox-ts in watch mode via `rbxtsc -w`. You can exit watch mode later by clicking on the command line and pressing `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard.

<center><img src={require("../static/img/setup-guide/rbxtsc-watch.png").default} /></center>

5. Next, start up a Rojo server. If you are using the Rojo VSCode extension, simply hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select `Rojo: Start Server`.

<center><img src={require("../static/img/setup-guide/rojo-extension.png").default} /></center>

Otherwise, open a new terminal with the same working directory and start Rojo via `rojo serve`. In VSCode a new terminal can be opened by pressing the `+` button.

<center><img src={require("../static/img/setup-guide/rojo-serve.png").default} /></center>

6. Open a new place in Roblox Studio where you wish to sync your compiled code into. Open up the Rojo plugin in Studio and hit `Connect`.

<center><img src={require("../static/img/setup-guide/rojo-plugin.png").default} /></center>

7. Write code! :tada:
